Research Project: Photon-Photon Interactions via Rydberg Blockade            
Advisor: Prof. Yongchang Zhang
Xi'an Jiaotong University

Description: There is no interaction between photons in vacuum, and the indirect interaction between photons is produced by coupling Rydberg atoms with photons.
Here, I used MATLAB to simulate the interaction between photons induced by Rydberg atoms, and completed the time evolution simulation.
You can find my coding work in this file, too!!!(such as:blablablabla.m) Please feel free to email me if you have any problems or suggestions!!!

Each Rydberg atom couples a photonï¼Œthe initial state satisfies the Gaussian distribution(It may not be a Gaussian distribution in a real experiment, but it is simpler to use a Gaussian distribution in a program simulation. After the program is debugged, you can choose the initial state at will.).

Situation 1: One-dimensional two-photon system; One of the photons is fixed and another one moves toward the first one.
xlabel: the location of the first photon
ylabel: the location of the second photon

Situation 2: One-dimensional two-photon system; Both photons move.
xlabel: the location of the first photon
ylabel: the location of the second photon

Situation 3: One-dimensional three-photon system; One of the photons is fixed and another two moves toward the first one.
xlabel: the location of the first photon
ylabel: the location of the second photon
zlabel: the location of the third photon
```

Situation 4: One-dimensional three-photon system; all of the photons move.
xlabel: the location of the first photon
ylabel: the location of the second photon
zlabel: the location of the third photon
```

Situation 5: two-dimensional two-photon system; one photon fixed while another one moves.
x1 and y1: the location of the first photon
x2 and y2: the location of the second photon
Still in progress......
