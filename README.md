### Research Experience 
```markdown
10/2021-12/2021.     The Crommie Group, University of California, Berkeley
Mentor: Professor Michael F. Crommie, Dr. Peter Jacobse, Graduate student Ziyi Wang

1. Contributed to a team of researhers aiming to use Scanning Tunneling Microscopy to analyze Graphene
   nanoribbons to look for their interesting physical properties.
2. Mastered many experiment skills such as making Graphene nanoribbon samples, transfering samples,
   annealing, sputtering, deposition, hot substrate deposition, loading molecules into the evaporator, 
   evaporating molecules onto the surface of sample, using mechanic pump, turbo pump and ion pump to 
   get ultra high vacuum, baking the Scanning Tunneling Microscopy system to remove impurity molecules, 
   refilling liquid Helium and liquid Nitrogen, using STM to scan the Graphene nanoribons, repairing 
   the tip to get higher resolution image.
3. I helped Graduate Ziyi Wang to do some data analysis work. I use python to analyze experimental data
   and to make plot.
