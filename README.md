Oct 2021 – Dec 2021			Crommie’s Group, Department of Physics                                       
Research Assistant, Advisors: Prof. Michael Crommie, Dr. Peter Jacobse & Graduate student Ziyi Wang

Project 1: “Daisy Chain” on Au(111) surface
Description: Studied the behavior of the magnetic ground state of dibenzoquateranthene (DBQA) on a 
	     gold surface with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). 
   	1. I learned to use Matrix-Assisted Direct (MAD) Transfer and Bottom-Up Approach to achieve an 
      	   on-surface synthesis of poly-DBQA from precursor iodophenyl-bromobianthryl (PBA).
   	2. With the help of Ziyi and Peter, I mastered many experimental skills of Scanning Probe Measurements, 
      	   such as annealing, sputtering, transferring samples, refilling liquid Helium and Liquid Nitrogen
   	3. I learned to use software to control STM to get topographic images of poly-DBQA chains on the 
           nanometer scale. (“Daisy Chain”)
	
Project 2: Five-fold structure on Au(111) surface
Description: Proposed a method for synthesizing five-fold structures on a gold surface.
   	1. I learned to use the Evaporation method and Bottom-Up approach to synthesize five-fold structures 
      	   from five-membered ring molecules.
   	2. I collaborated with Ziyi to get topographic images of five-point star structures by STM.
	
Project 3: Single strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) on Au(111) surface
Description: Studied the behavior and structure of single strands of DNA on a gold surface with STM.
   	1. I finished MAD Transfer independently to achieve the on-surface synthesis of single strands of DNA.
   	2. I collaborated with Peter to get topographic images of single strands of DNA by STM.

   If your are interested in these projects, we can have schedule a zoom meeting to have a chat.


   I mastered many experiment skills such as 
   
   annealing, 
   sputtering, 
   deposition, 
   transfering samples,
   hot substrate deposition, 
   loading molecules into the evaporator, 
   using STM to scan the Graphene nanoribons, 
   refilling liquid Helium and liquid Nitrogen,
   evaporating molecules onto the surface of sample, 
   repairing the tip to get higher resolution images,
   using mechanic pump, turbo pump and ion pump to get ultra high vacuum, 
   using bottom-up approach and MAD method to make Graphene nanoribbon samples, 
   baking the Scanning Tunneling Microscopy system to remove impurity molecules, 
   
   
   I was also responsibile for some data analysis work. I used python to help Ziyi to analyze experimental data
   and make plots.

#### Research in Xi'an Jiaotong University
```markdown
Mar 2022 – Nov 2022			Q_M Q_I C_A Group, School of Physics                                            
Research Assistant, Advisors: Prof. Yongchang Zhang & Graduate student Rong Ma
Project 1: Rydberg atoms and Quantum Information 
Description Proposed a method for achieving qubit by taking advantage of the long life span of Rydberg atoms. 
	1. I used the Heisenberg Equation and Group Operators for deducing the Hamiltonian matrix of 
	   the Rydberg-Atomic System.
	2. I used MATLAB to solve eigenvalues and eigenstates of the Hamiltonian matrix showing the 
	   expression of dark-state polariton.
	3. I achieved numerical simulation of Gaussian beam and Gaussian wave packets in the Rydberg 
	   atomic system under dark state polariton conditions.


   I also derived  Multi-Rydberg-atom system interaction Hamiltonian matrices, and I used Matlab to 
   solve the eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and the final drawing Energy-distance picture of this system, 
   which reproduced the results of Soft Core in this paper: 
  
Johnson, J. E., and S. L. Rolston. "Interactions between Rydberg-dressed atoms." Physical Review A 82.3 (2010): 033412. 
  
   Recent work: I am going to deriving the dark state of Multi-Rydberg-atom system, and plug this dark 
   state into Maxwell Bloch Equation, then we can get the space-time evolution equation of the dark state. 
   By numerically solving the difference equation, we can get the evolution image of the dark state over 
   time and space. We expect to get lower lateral diffusion and higher transmittance by adjusting parameters 
   such as decay rate, length of resonant cavity, etc.

  (The first paper is published in a Chinese Journal, and I am the first author. The English name of this paper 
   is Fluid Suspension and Its Stability ; The Chinese name of this paper is 流体悬浮及其稳定性探究 ; You can 
   Control+C, Control+V, and search the Chinese name of this paper in google scholar. You can find it, but this
   paper requires a Chinese university's account to download. This paper is writen in Chinese, so I use google 
   translate to tralslate this paper (maybe there are some grammatical mistake, but you can understand the main 
   work of this article), and I upload both Chinese version and English version in this CV website) This was my 
   first independent research, I start it in 2019(17 years old). I used almost one year to solve this question 
   and do experiments, and I used another one year to write this paper, submited it to the Journal, and revised 
   it. Many things were the first time for me to try, and the process was very difficult and time-consuming. 
   
   From my current perspective, the content of this article is very naive, and many methods are not rigorous. 
   However, this independent research process has greatly improved my scientific research ability, so that I have 
   been able to make a contribution to Prof. Crommie's Group in UC, Berkeley.)
