### Research Experience 
#### Research one
```markdown
10/2021-12/2021.                                 The Crommie Group, University of California, Berkeley
Mentor: Professor Michael F. Crommie, Dr. Peter Jacobse, Graduate student Ziyi Wang

1. Contributed to a team of researhers aiming to use Scanning Tunneling Microscopy to analyze Graphene
   nanoribbons to look for their interesting physical properties.
2. Mastered many experiment skills such as 
   using bottom-up approach and MAD method to make Graphene nanoribbon samples, 
   transfering samples,
   annealing, 
   sputtering, 
   deposition, 
   hot substrate deposition, 
   loading molecules into the evaporator, 
   evaporating molecules onto the surface of sample, 
   using mechanic pump, turbo pump and ion pump to get ultra high vacuum, 
   baking the Scanning Tunneling Microscopy system to remove impurity molecules, 
   refilling liquid Helium and liquid Nitrogen, 
   using STM to scan the Graphene nanoribons, 
   repairing the tip to get higher resolution images.
3. I helped Graduate Ziyi Wang to do some data analysis work. I use python to analyze experimental data
   and make plots.

#### Research two
```markdown
03/2022-Now                                   Prof. Yongchang Zhang's Group, Xi'an Jiaotong University 
Mentor: Professor Yongchang Zhang, Graduate Rong Ma 
  
1. Contributed to a team of researchers aming to use Rydberg atoms to achieve the function of qubit. 
2. I derived  Multi-Rydberg-atom system interaction Hamiltonian matrices, and I used Matlab to solve the 
   eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and the final drawing Energy-distance picture of this system, which 
   reproduced the results of Soft Core in this paper: 
  
Johnson, J. E., and S. L. Rolston. "Interactions between Rydberg-dressed atoms." Physical Review A 82.3 (2010): 033412. 
  
3. Recent work: I am going to deriving the dark state of Multi-Rydberg-atom system, and plug this dark 
   state into Maxwell Bloch Equation, then we can get the space-time evolution equation of the dark state. 
   By numerically solving the difference equation, we can get the evolution image of the dark state over 
   time and space. We expect to get lower lateral diffusion and higher transmittance by adjusting parameters 
   such as decay rate, length of resonant cavity, etc.
