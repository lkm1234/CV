10/2021-12/2021.                                 The Crommie Group, University of California, Berkeley
Mentor: Professor Michael F. Crommie, Dr. Peter Jacobse, Graduate student Ziyi Wang

1. Contributed to a team of researhers aiming to use Scanning Tunneling Microscopy to analyze Graphene
   nanoribbons to look for their interesting physical properties.
2. Mastered many experiment skills such as 
   using bottom-up approach and MAD method to make Graphene nanoribbon samples, 
   transfering samples,
   annealing, 
   sputtering, 
   deposition, 
   hot substrate deposition, 
   loading molecules into the evaporator, 
   evaporating molecules onto the surface of sample, 
   using mechanic pump, turbo pump and ion pump to get ultra high vacuum, 
   baking the Scanning Tunneling Microscopy system to remove impurity molecules, 
   refilling liquid Helium and liquid Nitrogen, 
   using STM to scan the Graphene nanoribons, 
   repairing the tip to get higher resolution images.
3. I helped Graduate Ziyi Wang to do some data analysis work. I use python to analyze experimental data
   and make plots.
4. project1-five-member rings: want to achieve five fold structure (My colleague, Dr. Peter H. Jacobse, 
   put my name on the paper. He is going to submit this paper to Nat. Commun Or Science Advances soon)
   project2-DNA molecules: want to achieve the ordered synthesis of GNR
   project3-a New Chervon type Graphene nanoribbon: want to achieve programmable fabrication of GNR
   If your are interested in these projects, we can have schedule a zoom meeting to have a chat.

03/2022-Now                                   Prof. Yongchang Zhang's Group, Xi'an Jiaotong University 
Mentor: Professor Yongchang Zhang, Graduate Rong Ma 
  
1. Contributed to a team of researchers aming to use Rydberg atoms to achieve the function of qubit. 
2. I derived  Multi-Rydberg-atom system interaction Hamiltonian matrices, and I used Matlab to solve the 
   eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and the final drawing Energy-distance picture of this system, which 
   reproduced the results of Soft Core in this paper: 
  
Johnson, J. E., and S. L. Rolston. "Interactions between Rydberg-dressed atoms." Physical Review A 82.3 (2010): 033412. 
  
3. Recent work: I am going to deriving the dark state of Multi-Rydberg-atom system, and plug this dark 
   state into Maxwell Bloch Equation, then we can get the space-time evolution equation of the dark state. 
   By numerically solving the difference equation, we can get the evolution image of the dark state over 
   time and space. We expect to get lower lateral diffusion and higher transmittance by adjusting parameters 
   such as decay rate, length of resonant cavity, etc.

1. 刘铠铭, 周亚杰, 赵述敏, 王红理. 流体悬浮及其稳定性探究. 物理实验. 2021.           
2. (the five-member rings work (in UC, Berkeley) is going to be submited to Nat. Commun or Science Advances)
```

```markdown
  (The first paper is published in a Chinese Journal, and I am the first author. The English name of this paper 
   is Fluid Suspension and Its Stability ; The Chinese name of this paper is 流体悬浮及其稳定性探究 ; You can 
   Control+C, Control+V, and search the Chinese name of this paper in google scholar. You can find it, but this
   paper requires a Chinese university's account to download. This paper is writen in Chinese, so I use google 
   translate to tralslate this paper (maybe there are some grammatical mistake, but you can understand the main 
   work of this article), and I upload both Chinese version and English version in this CV website) This was my 
   first independent research, I start it in 2019(17 years old). I used almost one year to solve this question 
   and do experiments, and I used another one year to write this paper, submited it to the Journal, and revised 
   it. Many things were the first time for me to try, and the process was very difficult and time-consuming. 
   
   From my current perspective, the content of this article is very naive, and many methods are not rigorous. 
   However, this independent research process has greatly improved my scientific research ability, so that I have 
   been able to make a contribution to Prof. Crommie's Group in UC, Berkeley.)
